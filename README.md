# Clustering
## Evaluation Parameters:
Silhouette Score:
The Silhouette Score is a widely used metric for evaluating the quality of clustering. It provides a measure of how well-defined and separated the clusters are within a dataset. The score is computed for each data point, ranging from -1 to 1. A higher Silhouette Score indicates that the data point is well-matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. Scores close to 0 suggest overlapping clusters, while negative scores imply potential misassignments. Overall, a higher Silhouette Score signifies more effective clustering.

Calinski-Harabasz Index:
The Calinski-Harabasz Index, or Variance Ratio Criterion, assesses the ratio of between-cluster variance to within-cluster variance. It serves as a quantitative measure for the separation and distinctiveness of clusters. A higher Calinski-Harabasz Index indicates better-defined and more separated clusters. The index is particularly sensitive to the shape of clusters and is valuable for scenarios where convex-shaped clusters are expected. By considering both within-cluster and between-cluster variances, this index provides insight into the overall effectiveness of the clustering algorithm.

Davies-Bouldin Index:
The Davies-Bouldin Index evaluates the compactness and separation of clusters, providing a measure of the quality of clustering based on both intra-cluster and inter-cluster distances. It calculates the average similarity ratio between each cluster and its most similar cluster. A lower Davies-Bouldin Index is indicative of better clustering, with lower values suggesting more compact and well-separated clusters. This metric is particularly useful when the true number of clusters is unknown, offering a comprehensive assessment of the clustering performance.
